### A beta regression

The Beta distribution is defined on the interval $(0, 1)$ and is described by two positive parameters, $\alpha$ and $\beta$, which shape the distribution.
The probability density function (pdf) of the Beta distribution is given by:

```math
f(y|\alpha,\beta) = \frac{\Gamma(\alpha + \beta)}{\Gamma(\alpha)\Gamma(\beta)} y^{\alpha - 1} (1 - y)^{\beta - 1}
```

and if writing block equations, `$$` need to follow immediately by the expressions.

$$f(y|\alpha,\beta) = \frac{\Gamma(\alpha + \beta)}{\Gamma(\alpha)\Gamma(\beta)}
y^{\alpha - 1} (1 - y)^{\beta - 1}$$
